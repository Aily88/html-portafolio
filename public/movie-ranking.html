<h1>The Best Movies According to Aily</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Pride & Prejudice</h3>
<p>This is my favourite period movie. I love the costume design and the ideas they express.</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>I love this sci-fi adventure movie. The portrayal of communication across space and time is fantastic.</p>

<h3>Bridget Jones's Diary</h3>
<p>I enjoy this comedy/romantic film a lot. It is one of my favourites in this genre because the principal character fights for his principles and values as a woman.</p>
